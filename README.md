This adapter saves state history into InfluxDB.

**No support of influxDB less or equal to 0.8!**

## Installation of InfluxDB
There is no InfluxDB for Windows!
Under debian you can install it with:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install influxdb
```

Explanation for other OS can be found [here](https://influxdb.com/docs/v0.9/introduction/installation.html).

### Setup authentication for influxDB (can be omitted)
If you use DB localy you may leave authentication disabled and skip this part.

- Start service: ``` service influxdb start ```
- Go to admin page: http://<ip>:8083
- Create users:
```
CREATE USER "admin" WITH PASSWORD '<adminpassword>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
CREATE USER "user" WITH PASSWORD '<userpassword>'
CREATE DATABASE "iobroker"
GRANT ALL ON "iobroker" TO "user"
```
Enable authentication, by editing /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf:
```
 [http]  
 enabled = true  
 bind-address = ":8086"  
 auth-enabled = true # âœ¨
 log-enabled = true  
 write-tracing = false  
 pprof-enabled = false  
 https-enabled = false  
 https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"  
```
- Restart service: ``` service influxdb restart ```



## Installation of Grafana
There is additional charting tool for InfluxDB - Grafana. 
It must be installed additionally.

Under debian you can install it with:

```
$ wget https://grafanarel.s3.amazonaws.com/builds/grafana_2.5.0_amd64.deb
$ sudo apt-get install -y adduser libfontconfig
$ sudo dpkg -i grafana_2.5.0_amd64.deb
```

Explanation for other OS can be found [here](http://docs.grafana.org/installation/).

After the Grafana is installed, follow [this](http://docs.grafana.org/datasources/influxdb/) to create connection.
